# Wordsmith

Wordsmith is my first beginner project as a front-end developer, and it is a word-guessing game that challenges players to guess a random word within a certain number of guesses.
It is built using vanilla JS and tailwindCSS. It will be gradually improved on as I learn more about front-end development!
